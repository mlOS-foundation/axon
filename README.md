# Axon - The Neural Pathway for ML Models

**Tagline**: "Signal. Propagate. Myelinate."

Axon is the transmission layer for ML models in MLOS. It's not just a package manager—it's the neural pathway that connects models to your operating system, optimized at the kernel level for maximum performance.

## Vision

Just as axons transmit signals between neurons to form neural networks, **Axon** provides the transmission layer for ML models in MLOS. It enables seamless model distribution, versioning, and lifecycle management with kernel-level optimizations.

### The Neural Metaphor

- **Neurons** = Individual models
- **Axons** = Transmission pathways (Axon CLI)
- **Myelin sheaths** = Kernel-level optimizations
- **Neural networks** = Model ecosystems
- **MLOS** = The substrate that makes it all work

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mlOS-foundation/axon.git
cd axon

# Build from source
make build

# Or install directly
make install
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize the axon pathway
axon init

# Search for models (discover neurons)
axon search resnet
axon search "image classification"

# Get model info (inspect the neuron)
axon info vision/resnet50
axon info vision/resnet50@1.0.0

# Install models (propagate signals)
axon install vision/resnet50          # Latest version
axon install vision/resnet50@2.0.0    # Specific version

# List installed (active pathways)
axon list

# Update model (strengthen the pathway)
axon update vision/resnet50

# Remove model (prune the pathway)
axon uninstall vision/resnet50
```
